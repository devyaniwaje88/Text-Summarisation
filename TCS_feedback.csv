26-Nov-19,"I'm going to share all of the below information after working for TCS for around 4 years. Good brand value, few of the projects will get you onsite opportunities.

:
- Salary on time
- Secure job
- Good Health Insurance
- Brand value
- Some discount on TATA brands and products like(Titan, Croma, Tata Motors, etc)","There are a lot of Pros and  but that completely depends on the project one is working on. TCS has one domain named ""NGM India"" and if you have been chosen in any of those projects, I will suggest you change or otherwise switch because all the projects are running on way too old technology and there are no onsite opportunities and the management will force you to work there for more than 3 years and a lot of drama to release you from the project. Though this is a TATA brand it is running on its fame only.

:
- Poor management
- Intensive politics
- HR and RMG are of no use, mostly they will blindly obey projects owner/manager
- NO WORK-LIFE BALANCE AT ALL
- Personal Growth is very slow though they have initiative for that
- Less pay compared to other organization","99% of your employees resigned because of their immediate supervisor and the attitude of the HR and the RMG department for not listening to employee's concerns. You should have some portal for anonymous complaint and I am pretty sure you will receive many complaints against the supervisor and their mental harassment. There is no freedom to choose a project of your choice or to switch from one project to another or to change the domain. I was working on a project of NGM India for more than 3 years and after a lot of struggle finally, I changed the project but not able to change the domain. Your unhelpful RMG department forced me to work on a way worst project in NGM India. Everything has a limit and that when that limit is crossed it forced us to resign.",2,Current Employee,Systems Engineer,Mumbai,1,4,2,2,1

The mammoth size of the organization and the perceived guaranteed job security makes decision making dreadfully slow, adaptation to change mostly reactionary and ham-fisted.
Learnings are difficult to apply as getting movements to desired opportunities get stuck in bureaucratic and personal machinations. 
One has to have a unique blend of technical brilliance, functional business capability, fantastic people manipulation skills and an unflinching ability not to be deflated by the overwhelming indifference to grow in the organization.
Pay is generally as per the services company cabal standards with ultra rare exceptions. 
In short both the employees and the clients are quite aware that performance at TCS is proportional to the service costs and just like cheap 50p candy at the cigarette shop it's cheap, made to minimum standards and the consolation of being a ultra-large business.","None.

2. Bathrooms are clean, and this combined with pro no. 1 tempts one to use bathrooms in the office more often than in their own homes.
3. Cafeteria food is cheap and not bad at all.","1. RMGs and Human Resources are rude, give no thought to what they're doing while assigning people to projects and have no qualms about potentially ruining careers of fresh grads by pushing them into projects that are aligned with neither their inclination nor their skill set.

2. The Initial Learning Program (ILP) that fresh grads have to go through is an utter travesty, with no ""learning"" to speak of. It's held at a location that's different from where you'll eventually be working (potentially several hundered Kms away from either your home or eventual work location) and since TCS does not reimburse you for the travel, you have travel expenses even before your career has begun.

3. People trained in Java are being pushed into ITIS projects and people with genuine, demonstrable coding skills are being held like prisoners in projects that simply do not suit them, simply because they were trained in ITIS. RMGs will employ sophistry and absurd mental gymnastics to justify things like this.

4. The work you'll most likely be assigned to do will be some repetitive inanity that has nothing to do with all that you've learned in school, college and their useless ILP, most which could be easiliy automated with barely 50 lines of Python (speaking from experience here). Things like MS Word, Powerpoint and Excel are the ""cutting-edge technologies"" that'll be taking up most of your time and making sure the TCS logo is aligned properly will be near the top of your priority.

4. Abnoxious and egotistical people with exceptionally bad managerial accumen are, for whatever reason, made managers in this company, who, with one metaphorical stroke of their pens can turn clear win-win situations into lose-lose situations, disappointing all stakeholders in a process except themselves.

5. Want to innovate and think outside the box?

1) You are one of those 5 lakh employees. Nobody really cares what you do, where you go, when you come to office until you are in a very critical role
2) Can switch roles easily if you dont like being a developer. 
3) Everyone gets ""A"" band nowadays. Hence even if you perform less you can consider yourself being lucky.
4) Lots of fun activities and in campus facilities inside campus like Painting competitions, IRC, free bus/cab services etc.
5) Has a lot of accounts and projects hence job security is high. Again no IT company assures your job location and security.
6) Can survive long time doing less work or even doing nothing. 
7) UK and Middle East onsite opportunity.
8) Giving job to almost everyone and for every qualifications like BSC, BCA , BTECH, CA etc.","1) Bad mouthed seniors and managers. Almost everyone shouts at everyone. Even juniors shout at seniors. If you keep quiet and just do your work this is not a place for you.
2) You will be micromanaged by your supervisors. You have to explain personal details for taking leaves, W.F.H etc.
3) Previously hike percentage for A band employees were around 12%. Now it is reduced to 8% (All are getting A. LOL)
4) You are treated like a headcount. You will be asked to do any kind of work. Even some freshers are asked to do birthday listings.
5) Typical ""Sarkari"" culture like, coming office at 2 pm and going home by 9 pm.
6) Very less development projects.
7) Even if there are few development projects where people are asked to stay for almost 11 hours and to work on weekends.
8) Getting US onsite is almost impossible for nowadays.
9) After agile ODCs are introduced you will feel like working in a call center. No privacy .
10) Very tough to get a machine for new joiners Sometimes even you will not be provided a seat and then you will be asked to show productivity. 
11) Intake is very high. You might feel lost in the sea.
12) Work allocation is not done properly. In a team of 10 people 8 seat idle. 2 people have to do 10 persons work. Hence they have to work in tremendous pressure. Again this will not be highlighted at the time of Appraisal.
13) Oiling and buttering culture is prominent. Hell lot of politics present here. One who oils the seniors, is the boss here.",Change the work culture.

03-Jun-20,"1) No salary cuts currently in the ""After Corona"" era.
2) No job cuts yet in the ""After Corona"" era. (But there's widespread apprehension within that they're quiet now to avoid negative publicity. But from Q3 FY21 onwards, could start retrenchments, citing their bogus performance appraisal reasons.)","1) A sweatshop offering barely minimum wage everywhere possible, across geographies.
2) Mostly, associates work for peanuts, & even don't get the amount stated in their compensation letter. Because the Business Unit heads have unachievable revenue targets that don't get met, employees always get a big chunk of their variable components eaten away, because the units don't meet those unrealistic targets.
3) Salaries of employees mostly remain constant, even if designations rarely increase. Seniority, though not necessarily reflected in the salary, is frowned upon within.
4) The appraisal process is the worst! From mid-senior levels especially, the ""curve-fitting"" gets decided by the amount of sycophancy, denigration of peers & ostentatious self-advertisement. HRs are a mere stooge of mgmt when it comes to appraisal disputes.
5) Promotions have almost stopped, stating pyramid rationalization excuses. The mgmt deliberately screws the appraisals, in order to break the cycle & curb the development of eligibilities (which are mere guidance anyways, & never an assurance for promotion).
6) Even more so under the current CEO, everything is driven by revenue numbers, instead of quality.
7) To client organizations in the UK/US, the company image is that of a mere sweatshop for executing menial operations. The ""ultancy"" part is non-existent due to revenue and numbers-driven approach to lap up support contracts at dirt cheap rates.
8) The company doesn't even figure in the discussions of clients when it comes to the prestigious consulting, architecture & new implementation assignments. 
9) Most of the employee base, senior mgmt (Segment Heads, Client Partners, BRMs, Account Owners, Account Managers) included, are inept communicators, often displaying their gross shortcomings when it comes to verbal & written communication, even with their customers! And nowadays, the quality of soft skills of the junior employee base has degraded to appalling proportions - again directly related to a number based recruitment approach in hordes, instead of rooting for quality talent from premier institutes.
10) Most of the initiatives from mgmt & HR rear up as overnight emergencies (with already expired deadlines), instead of a planned & thoughtful approach.
11) Lack of transparency is rampant in the organizational culture, widespread across every imaginable field - appraisals, employee benefits, HR policies, presales, account mgmt, meeting employee growth aspirations to name a few.
12) In the name of cost-cutting, harnessing employee experience & convenience has been thrown away for a toss. This is not applicable for senior mgmt though, who get to enjoy more than their fair share of complimentary luxury (everything imaginable), while regular associates are meted with a second-class treatment, & don't even get to experience the basic sanitary requirements of hygienic washrooms & proper facility upkeep, let alone enjoying the fancy experience of the execs.
13) Canteens have a decently balanced co-existence of cockroaches, flies, dogs, birds, rodents (and ... oh! employees).
14) The latest WFH gizmo model is supposed to stay even after normalcy resumes, & it seems employees have no voice to make a choice. They were made to carry their bulky office desktops home themselves, irrespective of the distance they're located away from their offices.
15) After all these, still, the company always maintains a ""GREEN"" status w.r.t. all the standards, through eye-washing compliance exercises.
16) Work-life balance? But there's always an emergency, artificially created, because of immediate demands from top-down.

17) Oh yes! We need to mention the annual employee survey of the company, literally thrust upon the employees from top-down instead of being voluntary, in the name of assessing their sense of satisfaction!","Being a bit employee-friendly & empathetic to their financial, aspirational, & intellectual needs, instead of getting mindlessly consumed by numbers, could go a long way in transforming the organization into a happy workplace, instead of a sweatshop.",2,Current Employee,Team Lead,Mumbai,1,1,1,1,1

04-Jun-20,If I write pros about this company that will be joke of the century..!,"I am current employer, Working in this company for last 5 years. Management is stupid and I can't write words as it looks very abuse. TCS don't care about employees. They only bother about billing. One of the goal in appraisals will be ""you should not take more than one sick leave in quarter"". As a lead to add this as a goal to my You can understand just from this how your work life balance will be at this company. If you are placed at client place, TCS managers don't come and take your feedback not atleast once in a year. They don't even read appreciation mails that forwarded by client managers. Our client managers are also surprised about how these TCS managers behaviour as your managers didnt come and ask for the feedback (but they will come and eat at the parties that are organized by client, even though dont have invitation to those, they just bring client id card on that day). No recognition even though you get recognized by the client with prestigious awards.. At the end of the financial year they said no hikes. I am worrying what happen to our efforts that we put day and night and days for customer and at the end we are not getting anything. But still they donate Rs.1000 crore that is direct cut from our salary hikes. I am not against donating funds for COVID-19 if it is from TATA pocket. TCS management is didn't approve certification reimbursements. I am fighting on this for last 1 year but they didnt reimburse. One more thing we have daily call just for timesheet filling on daily basis that too you have to fill your timesheet before 11 AM in the morning. Except timesheet they dont care anything about employees. Managers job is only follow up on timesheet. Apart from these they dont do anything else. Pathetic management. In last 5 years i didnt get single chocolate from this company. No outing from project budget. Managers are eating this fund like rats. Ratan Tata do you know this or you are still sleeping. Where this money is going I strongly recommend, please dont join the TCS unless you are unfit ofr any other companies. its not employee favour company. very less salaries compared to other lot of companies and industry standards though you proved skillful person, you get only the very basic salary. Also HRs are like dolls with their key in managers. I want to bring one more thing is during this lock down you know we are all doing WFH. I am working at one of the prestigious client and they are paying Rs.1000 as internet reimbursement charges but this TCS people are looting around 60% of this money and they are paying only around Rs.400. How cheap is this? Is this the No.1 IT B(r)a(n)d (what they so used to called themselves) what it supposed to do? Even after reading this if you still decide to join in this company either as a fresher or lateral EVEN GOD CANNOT SAVE YOU.!",,1,Current Employee,Assistant Consultant,Bangalore,1,1,1,1,1
